   <h2 style="font-size:1.9em;"> On heterozygosity at a locus under selection</h2>

   <br>
   <p>Pairwise heterozygosity – or the probability that two alleles sampled from a population differ at a locus – is a measure of genetic diversity widely employed in population genetics. Mathematically, it can be expressed as</p>
    <p style="text-align: center; display: block; ">$ H = \langle 1 - \sum_i f_i^2 \rangle $,</p>
   <p>where $f_i$ denotes the population frequency of allele $i$, and the expectation $\langle .\rangle$ is taken over independent realizations of evolutionary dynamics.</p>
   <p>In the simplest model of evolution, $$f_i$$ depends on the rate at which loci mutate between allelic states, selection acting on fitness differences conferred by mutation, and random drift arising due to finite population size $N$. For $i\in\{0,1\}$, corresponding to the one-locus two-allele haploid<sup>1</sup> model, a solution for the allele frequency distribution was first derived by <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.23.6.307" target="_blank">Wright (1937)</a> in the limit of large $N$. Moments such as $H$ can be straightforwardly calculated from this distribution.</p>
   <p>We forgo the aforementioned result and instead propose a heuristic argument<sup>2</sup>. If mutation is infrequent (such that $0\rightarrow1$ flips occur at a total rate of $N\mu \ll 1$ per unit time), the population comprises primarily wildtype alleles. The vast majority of mutant lineages are short-lived, vanishing after only a few generations due to drift. However, some will survive long enough to reach appreciable frequencies. These dynamics are transient: eventually, each mutant lineage will either go extinct or take over the population<sup>3</sup>. The details of this process depend strongly on how mutation affects fitness.</p>
