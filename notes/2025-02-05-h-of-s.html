   <h2 style="font-size:1.9em;"> On heterozygosity at a locus under selection</h2>
   <p style="font-size:0.95em;"> February 5, 2025</p>
   <br>
      <p>Pairwise heterozygosity – or the probability that two alleles sampled from a population differ at a locus – is a measure of genetic diversity widely employed in population genetics. Mathematically, it can be expressed as</p>
          <p style="text-align: center; display: block; ">$ \displaystyle{H = \langle 1 - \sum_i f_i^2 \rangle} $,</p>
      <p>where $f_i$ denotes the population frequency of allele $i$, and the expectation $\langle .\rangle$ is taken over independent realizations of evolutionary dynamics.</p>
      <p>In the simplest model of evolution, $f_i$ depends on the rate at which loci mutate between allelic states, selection acting on fitness differences conferred by mutation, and random drift arising due to finite population size $N$. For $i\in\{0,1\}$, corresponding to the one-locus two-allele haploid<sup>1</sup> model, a solution for the allele frequency distribution was first derived by <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.23.6.307" target="_blank">Wright (1937)</a> in the limit of large $N$. Moments such as $H$ can be straightforwardly calculated from this distribution.</p>
      <p>We forgo the aforementioned result and instead propose a heuristic argument<sup>2</sup>. If mutation is infrequent (such that $0\rightarrow1$ flips occur at a total rate $N\mu \ll 1$ per unit time), the population comprises primarily wildtype alleles. The vast majority of mutant lineages are short-lived, vanishing after only a few generations due to drift. However, some will survive long enough to reach appreciable frequencies. These dynamics are transient: eventually, each mutant lineage will either go extinct or take over the population<sup>3</sup>. The details of this process depend strongly on how mutation affects fitness.</p>

   <h2>Neutral alleles</h2>
   <p>If mutation has no effect on fitness, the frequency of a mutant lineage is only influenced by drift. With probability $1/t$, this lineage will survive for at least $t$ generations, reaching a characteristic size of $f \sim t/N$. A more rigorous calculation (<a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-mathematical-statistics/volume-19/issue-1/On-the-Generalized-Birth-and-Death-Process/10.1214/aoms/1177730285.full" target="_blank">Kendall, 1948</a>) shows that the frequency of the surviving lineage is exponentially distributed around this characteristic size,</p>
      <p style="text-align: center; display: block; ">$ \displaystyle{p(f|f>0) df \sim \frac{N}{t} e^{-Nf/t} df} $,</p>
   <p>which implies that, on a logarithmic scale, most of the probability density is contained within $\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ of $\log (t/N) $.</p>
   <p>The allele frequency distribution can be understood in terms of the number of mutant lineages that end up in the frequency range $\log f \pm \mathcal{O}(1)$ at time $t$. The rate at which mutant lineages reach frequency $f$ is $N\mu \cdot 1/Nf$, and lineages that do so must have originated within $\Delta t \sim Nf$ generations in the past. Summing up their contributions yields</p>
      <p style="text-align: center; display: block; ">$ \displaystyle{p(\log f) \sim N\mu \cdot \frac{1}{Nf} \cdot \Delta t \sim N\mu} $,</p>
   <p>emphasizing that $p(f)$ is evenly distributed on a logarithmic scale, with equal contributions from all orders of magnitude in $f$. Switching back to a linear scale, we recover the familiar allele frequency distribution,</p>
      <p style="text-align: center; display: block; ">$ \displaystyle{p(f) \sim \frac{N\mu}{f}}$.</p>
   <p>Note that this calculation is only valid for $t \ll N$. At longer times, there is $\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ probability that a mutant lineage will have reached $f\sim 1$, or <em>fixed</em>. For a steady state to exist, we thus need an influx of new mutations; <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2984310?seq=1" target="_blank">Ewens (1963)</a> showed that this can be achieved by restarting the process at some infinitesimal frequency $\epsilon$ immediately upon fixation<sup>4</sup>.</p>
   <p>The pairwise heterozygosity is therefore given by</p>
      <p style="text-align: center; display: block; ">$ \displaystyle{H \sim \langle f(1-f) \rangle \sim \int_{\epsilon}^1 f(1-f) p(f) df \sim N\mu} $,</p>
   <p>in agreement with the exact result $H=2N\mu$ up to an $\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant.</p>
   <br>
   <h2>Deleterious alleles</h2>
   <p>The frequency dynamics of alleles with a fitness <em>cost</em> $s$ differ only in that selection prevents them from reaching frequencies much larger than $1/Ns$, preserving the shape of $p(f)$ below $f\sim 1/Ns$. We can see that moments of the frequency distribution such as $H$ will be dominated by these frequencies, provided $Ns \gg 1$,</p>
      <p style="text-align: center; display: block; ">$ \displaystyle{H \sim \int_{0}^{1/Ns} f(1-f) p(f) df \sim \frac{\mu}{s}}$.</p>
   <br>
   <h2>Beneficial alleles</h2>
   <p>Just like deleterious alleles, strongly advantageous alleles with fitness <em>benefit</em> $s$ will remain invisible to selection at frequencies below $1/Ns$. However, if they drift to this frequency, they begin to expand deterministically due to selection as</p>
      <p style="text-align: center; display: block; ">$ \displaystyle{\partial_t f = sf(1-f)}$.</p>
   <p>As they sweep through the population, they will contribute to heterozygosity</p>
      <p style="text-align: center; display: block; ">$ \displaystyle{H \sim N\mu \cdot s \cdot \int_{0}^{1/s \log Ns} f(1-f) dt \sim N\mu \cdot s \cdot \frac{1}{s} \sim N\mu} $,</p>
   <p>which is much larger than the contribution from lineages that are still drifting since $Ns \gg 1$. Therefore, perhaps surprisingly, we see that beneficial mutations give rise to heterozygosity similar to that observed for neutral mutations. This is because while beneficial alleles reach frequencies where $f(1-f) \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ with probability $s$, they spend only $1/s$ generations passing through.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><sup>1</sup> In diploid organisms, heterozygosity often refers to the probability that two alleles at a locus differ in state <em>within an individual</em>, rather than across the population. If the dominance coefficient is $1/2$, the diploid system is equivalent to the haploid case considered here, with a rescaled population size. Other kinds of dominance fall outside our simple model.</p>
   <p class="footnote"><sup>2</sup> This argument follows from the work of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/176/3/1759/6062236" target="_blank">Desai and Fisher (2007)</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580909000264" target="_blank">Weissman et al.

   <p class="footnote"><sup>3</sup> Note that at long times, it is sufficient to know the probability mass at $f_i = 1$, or the <em>fixation</em> probability, to find the first moment of the distribution. This is not the case for higher moments, which depend on the lineage trajectory in addition to its ultimate fate. This distinction between <em>divergence</em> statistics such as $\langle f_i \rangle$ and <em>polymorphism</em> statistics such as $\langle f_i^2 \rangle$ underlies many inference approaches in population genetics (see e.g. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/351652a0" target="_blank">McDonald and Kreitman, 1991</a>).</p>
   <p class="footnote"><sup>4</sup> Specifically, reinstating the mutant lineage in this way changes the overall normalization constant of the distribution $p(f)$, but does not alter its shape.</p>
