Pairwise heterozygosity – or the probability that two alleles sampled from a population differ at a locus – is a measure of genetic diversity widely employed in population genetics. Mathematically, it can be expressed as  

$$ H  = \langle {1 - \sum_i f_i^2} \rangle, $$    

where $$f_i$$ denotes the population frequency of allele $$i$$, and the expectation $$\langle .\rangle$$ is taken over independent realizations of evolutionary dynamics.

In the simplest model of evolution, $$f_i$$ depends on the rate at which loci mutate between allelic states, selection acting on fitness differences conferred by mutation, and random drift arising due to finite population size $$N$$. For $$i\in\{0,1\}$$, corresponding to the one-locus two-allele model, a steady-state solution for the allele frequency distribution was first derived by [Wright (1937)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.23.6.307) in the limit of large $$N$$.  

We forgo this result and instead propose a heuristic argument<sup>1</sup>. If mutation is infrequent (such that $$0\rightarrow1$$ mutations arise at a total rate of $$N\mu \ll 1$$ per unit time), the population consists primarily of wildtype alleles. The vast majority of mutant lineages are short-lived, vanishing after only a few generations due to drift. However, some will survive long enough to reach appreciable frequencies. The dynamics of this process depend strongly on how mutation affects fitness.  

<br />

## Neutral alleles
If mutation has no effect on fitness, the frequency of a mutant lineage is only influenced by drift. With probability $$1/t$$, this lineage will survive for at least $$t$$ generations, reaching a characteristic size of $$f(t) \sim t/N$$. A more rigorous calculation shows that the frequency of the surviving lineage is exponentially distributed around this characteristic size, so that  

$$ p(f|f>0) df \sim \frac{N}{t} e^{-Nf/t} df. $$  

Integrating over the possible ages of the surviving lineage yields the familiar allele frequency distribution,   

$$ p(f) df \sim \int_0^{\infty} N\mu dt \cdot \frac{1}{t} \cdot \frac{N}{t} e^{-Nf/t} df \sim \frac{N\mu}{f} df.$$

The pairwise heterozygosity is therefore given by  

$$ H \sim \langle f(1-f) \rangle \sim \int_0^1 f(1-f) \cdot p(f) df \sim N\mu. $$   

<br />

## Deleterious alleles
The frequency dynamics of alleles with a fitness cost $$s$$ are different only in that selection prevents them from reaching frequencies much larger than $$1/Ns$$. We can see that moments of $$p(f)$$ such as $$H$$ will be dominated by these frequencies, provided $$Ns \gg 1$$,  

$$ H \sim \langle f(1-f) \rangle \sim \int_0^{1/Ns} f(1-f) \cdot p(f) df \sim \frac{\mu}{s}. $$
