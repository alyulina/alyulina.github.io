_In progress; please come back later._

Pairwise heterozygosity – or the probability that two alleles sampled from a population differ at a locus – is a measure of genetic diversity widely employed in population genetics. Mathematically, it can be expressed as  

$$ H  = \langle 1 - \sum_i f_i^2 \rangle, $$    

where $$f_i$$ denotes the population frequency of allele $$i$$, and the expectation $$\langle . \rangle$$ is taken over independent realizations of evolutionary dynamics.

In the simplest model of evolution, $$f_i$$ depends on the rate at which loci mutate between allelic states, selection acting on fitness differences conferred by mutation, and random drift arising due to finite population size $$N$$. For $$i\in\{0,1\}$$, corresponding to the one-locus two-allele model, a steady-state solution solution for the allele frequency distribution was first derived by Wright (1938) in the limit of large $$N$$.  

We forgo this result and instead propose a heuristic argument<sup>1</sup>. If the mutation rate is low (such that $$0\rightarrow1$$ mutations arise at a total rate of $$N\mu \ll 1$$ per unit time), the population consists primarily of wildtype alleles. The vast majority of mutant lineages are short-lived, vanishing after only a few generations due to drift. However, some will survive long enough to reach appreciable frequencies. The dynamics of this process depend strongly on how mutation affects fitness.  

## Neutral alleles
If mutation has no effect on fitness, the frequency of a mutant lineage is only influenced by drift. With probability $$1/t$$, this lineage will survive for at least $$t$$ generations, reaching a characteristic size of $$f(t) \sim t/N$$. More detailed calculation shows that the frequency of the surviving lineage is exponentially distributed around this characteristic size, so that  

$$ p(f|f>0) df \sim \frac{N}{t} e^{-Nf/t} df. $$
