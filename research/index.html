		<h2>Theoretical population genetics</h2>
		<p>I am interested in the dynamics that arise when evolutionary forces act on overlapping time scales. I derive theoretical predictions for patterns of genetic variation in such scenarios and identify phenomena that emerge when classical assumptions – like steady-state behavior or separation of time scales – break down. My work spans allele frequency spectra under time-varying demography and selection, as well as <a href="https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/228/3/iyae145/7747749" target="_blank">correlations between selected alleles at linked loci</a>.</p>

		<h2>Evolutionary dynamics in natural populations</h2>
		<p>I enjoy collaborating with field biologists to understand the evolutionary forces shaping natural populations. In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-025-02853-x" target="_blank">recent project</a>, I analyzed temporal genotype frequency data to show that dominance reversal (when an allele switches from being beneficial and dominant to deleterious and recessive) helps maintain polymorphism in <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>. Earlier, I studied how past population growth contributed to deleterious variation in the critically endangered <em>Calidris pygmaea</em>.</p>

		<h2>Somatic evolution</h2>
		<p>I study how growth, competition, and diversification in cellular populations shape their collective dynamics over time. In collaboration with the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/winslowlab.html/" target="_blank">Winslow lab</a>, I infer tumor growth rates across space and time from genetic barcoding data. I focus on explaining which features of early tumor growth kinetics generate the broad distributions of clonal tumor sizes observed in experiments.</p>
