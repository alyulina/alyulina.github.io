		<h2>Theoretical population genetics</h2>
		<p>I am interested in the dynamics that arise when evolutionary forces act on overlapping time scales. I derive theoretical predictions for patterns of genetic variation in such scenarios and identify phenomena that emerge when classical assumptions – like steady-state behavior or separation of time scales – break down. My work spans allele frequency spectra under time-varying demography and selection, as well as <a href="https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/228/3/iyae145/7747749" target="_blank">correlations between selected alleles at linked loci</a>.</p>

		<h2>Evolutionary dynamics in natural populations</h2>
		<p>I enjoy collaborating with field biologists to understand the evolutionary forces shaping natural populations. In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-025-02853-x" target="_blank">recent project</a>, I analyzed temporal genotype frequency data to show that dominance reversal (when an allele switches from being beneficial and dominant to deleterious and recessive) helps maintain polymorphism in <i>D. melanogaster</i>. Previously, I studied how past population growth contributed to deleterious variation in the critically endangered <em>C. pygmaea</em>.</p>

		<h2>Kinetics of early cancer growth</h2>
		<p>In collaboration with the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/winslowlab.html/" target="_blank">Winslow lab</a>, I study tumor growth rates across space and time using genetic barcoding. I am especially interested in understanding which aspects of early tumor growth kinetics give rise to the broad distributions of clonal tumor sizes observed in experimental data.</p>
