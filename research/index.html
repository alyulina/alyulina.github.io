		<h2><strong>Genetic diversity under nonequilibrium demography</strong></h2>
		<p> Natural populations are seldom constant in size; these demographic changes can lead to interactions between selection and genetic drift that fall outside of equilibrium models. I am interested in the patterns of genetic diversity that arise in populations of changing sizes, and the underlying allele frequency dynamics.</p>

		<h2><strong>Statistics of linked loci</strong></h2>
		<p> Together with <a href="https://zhiru-liu.github.io/" target="_blank">Zhiru Liu</a> and
		<a href="https://bgoodlab.github.io/" target="_blank">Benjamin Good</a>, I study how correlations between alleles are shaped by the interplay of selection, mutation, recombination, and drift. We use our theoretical predictions to gain insight into the rates of horizontal gene transfer in bacterial populations.</p>

		<h2><strong>Temporal and spatial dynamics of cancer progression</strong></h2>
		<p>In collaboration with the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/winslowlab.html/" target="_blank">Winslow lab</a>, I work on characterizing tumor growth rates across space and time using genetic barcoding.</p>

		<!--<p><strong>Population genetics of critically endangered species</strong></p>-->
		<!--<p>Before starting graduate school, I worked as a research assistant with <a href="https://www.oist.jp/research/fyodor-kondrashov/" target="_blank">Fyodor Kondrashov</a>. There, I used simulations and mathematical modeling to learn how past changes in the population size of a critically endangered bird species, <i>Calidris pygmaea</i>, contributed to its present-day genetic diversity.</p>-->
